#Nand2Tetris Overview

This folder details how I implemented the main hardware parts that make up the Nand2Tetis Hack computer those being the ALU, resgisters, RAM, PC, (currently working on the Memory, CPU, and Computer), to build an understanding of basic computer architecture. Contained here are my own diagrams currently for A Register and RAM block.

## What i've built throughout the course
- Combinational logic blocks: (16-bit Mux, DMux, etc...)
- Arithmetic blocks: (ALU, Adders, Inc)
- Sequential blocks: (Register, RAM, PC)
