#Nand2Tetris Overview

This folder details how I implemented the main hardware parts that make up the Nand2Tetis Hack computer those being the ALU, resgisters, RAM, PC, (currently working on the Memory, CPU, and Computer), to build an understanding of basic computer architecture and what it actually means to work in 0's and 1's.

## What i've built throughout the course
- Combinational logic blocks: (16-bit Mux, DMux, etc...)
- Arithmetic blocks: (ALU, Adders, Inc)
- Sequential blocks: (Register, RAM, PC)
